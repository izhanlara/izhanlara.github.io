I’m <strong>Izhan Lara</strong>, a web developer passionate about creating
        digital experiences that combine aesthetics, performance, and functionality.
        I love building clean yet distinctive interfaces and turning ideas into visually
        appealing projects.
</p> <p>
I have experience working with <strong>React, Astro, JavaScript, PHP, Node.js, Angular, Astro, and Discord.js</strong>,
        as well as frontend technologies focused on modern design. I particularly enjoy
        crafting animated, responsive interfaces with attention to every detail.
</p> <p>
I’ve developed projects such as <strong>OptiRuta</strong> (an application to optimize logistic routes),
        along with technical documentation for Notion and academic material to improve my future references.
        I also created <strong>Icon</strong>, a Discord bot that reached over 100 servers,
        automating moderation and social features.
</p> <p>
Additionally, I have experience at <strong>ISB Instalaciones</strong>, a family business specializing in fire protection systems.
        During this time, I learned to configure VPNs, servers, backups, and develop the company’s website using WordPress.
</p> <p>
Outside of coding, I’m passionate about <strong>cars, motorcycles, photography, and music</strong>.
        I’m always looking to learn something new and refine every detail of what I do.
